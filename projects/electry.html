    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <div>
      <p><span class="hl-yellow">Electry is pitched as “LinkedIn for skilled blue-collar workers.”</span></p>
      <p>With a team of 3 others, I <span class="hl-yellow">iteratively designed Electry's web interface</span>, beginning with low-fidelity designs and culminating in user testing.</p>
      <p>I chose Electry, because I wanted to explore a familiar problem to students — finding employment — in a different industry — blue-collar work.</p>

    <h4>Part 1</h4>
    <h2>Low-Fi Designs</h2>
    <p>
      Essentially, <span class="hl-yellow">Electry is a job board to connect blue-collar workers with companies looking to hire</span> them.
      Companies publish job openings on the platform, workers to find opportunities that match their qualifications
      and preferences, then the companies can follow-up with applicants off-platform.
    </p>
    <h3>Sketches</h3>
    <p>
      We began by independently creating <span class="hl-yellow"> rough sketches to brainstorm without the bias of other people's ideas</span>.
      Some drew interfaces heavily inspired by LinkedIn, others focused more on the job-seeker onboarding flow, still others designed from the company's POV.
      <br />
      My rough sketches:

      <div class="flex-col sketch-item">
        <img class="sketch-img" src="../assets/imgs/electry/sketch1-1.JPG" alt="first sketch set">
        <span class="caption">Home (logged in): social feed of posts</span>
      </div>
      <div class="flex-col sketch-item">
        <img class="sketch-img" src="../assets/imgs/electry/sketch1-2.JPG" alt="first sketch set">
        <span class="caption">Search Results: people/companies, connect/follow</span>

      <div class="flex-col sketch-item">
        <img class="sketch-img" src="../assets/imgs/electry/sketch1-3.JPG" alt="first sketch set">
        <span class="caption">User Profile: about, experience, skils, stats</span>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Wireframes</h3>
    <p>
      We then came together to decide on <span class="hl-yellow">1 cohesive concept</span> and manifested it in several <span class="hl-yellow">wireframes</span>.
      <br />Some examples:
    </p>
    <div class="flex">
      <div class="flex-col wf-item">
        <img class="wf-img" src="../assets/imgs/electry/wireframe4.png" alt="first sketch set">
        <span class="caption">Employee POV search results: people/companies, connect/follow</span>
      </div>
      <div class="flex-col wf-item">

        <span class="grid-caption">User Profile: about, experience, skils, stats</span>
      </div>
      <div class="flex-col wf-item">

  <section id="Hi-Fi" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
        <h4>Part 2</h4>
    <h2>Hi-Fi Mockups</h2>
    <p>
      Based on those wireframes, we created high-fidelity prototypes with Figma.
      During our prototyping process, we received <span class="hl-yellow">feedback from an industry UIUX expert</span>.
      From this feedback, our most notable changes were to <span class="hl-yellow">1. "gamify" the onboarding</span> process to be a flow — and 2. narrow our focus to <span class="hl-yellow">only job-seekers</span>.
    </p>
    <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450"
      src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FALXZInUp1XbtHk0qbNk4Pz%2FElectry-Design-Hi-Fi-Mockups%3Fnode-id%3D0%253A1"
      allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <p><br/><br />Notable concepts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="hl-yellow">Succinct profile building</span> process includes only essential information</li>
      <li><span class="hl-yellow">Onboarding personalizes user's experience</span> through onboarding, exploring job
        openings, and expressing interest</li>
    </ul>
  </section>


  <section id="User Testing" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000" class="grey">
    <h4>Part 3</h4>
    <h2>User Testing</h2>
    <p>We conducted our own <span class="hl-yellow">usability test through a remote user testing service (UserTesting.com)</span>, using our interative Figma prototype.</p>
    <p>Their scenario: You are a trained blue-collar worker looking for a job.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Subtask 1: Sign up by <span class="hl-yellow">completing the onboarding process</span>. Answer every question in the survey.</li>
      <li>Subtask 2: Now that you have a list of employers that match your preferences, <span class="hl-yellow">explore your recommended jobs</span> and <span class="hl-yellow">share your profile with 1 employer</span></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>
        The UserTesting results were very positive! They showed that users were <span class="hl-yellow">generally able to complete the tasks without any issues.</span>
        Users <span class="hl-yellow">enjoyed the interface's "simplicity and visual cues"</span>.</p>

    <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
    <p>
      Some users <span class="hl-yellow">had trouble navigating away from “My Jobs”</span>.
      Because of this, we should <span class="hl-yellow">add a "Go back" button</span> to the page to assist in navigation.</p>

  <section id="Takeaways" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
    <h2>Takeaways</h2>
    <p>This is one of few projects during which I interacted firsthand with users of my product.
      Feedback from the industry expert and regular users was immensely rewarding, and expedited the iteration process.
      It illustrated how we often subconsciously design according to our own biases and the importance of a diverse team.
